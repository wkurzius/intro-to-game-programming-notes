# 4: Turtles and functions

- First step towards creating a game
- We'll use the `turtle` module that comes with Python installations
- We'll control a 'turtle' and use it to create simple graphics

## The `turtle` module

- Create a new script (File > New File in IDLE) and save it, making sure to give it a meaningful name (e.g. `turtle_script.py`)
- Enter in the following code (you can omit the comments) and run it (Run > Run Module or F5 in IDLE)
- A window should appear with an arrow drawn in it

```python
import turtle

bob = turtle.Turtle()   # creates a Turtle object and assigns it to the variable bob
bob.forward(100)        # moves our Turtle named bob forward 100 pixels

turtle.mainloop()       # waits for user input (no effect when run from IDLE)
```

- The `turtle` module provides a function called `Turtle` that creates a Turtle object, which we assign to a variable named bob
- Other functions exist that manipulate the 'turtle', `forward` is one of them
- The `100` argument is for distance in pixels
- To turn your turtle, use the `left` or `right` functions
- They an angle as an argument

```python
import turtle

bob = turtle.Turtle()
bob.forward(100)
bob.left(90)        # turn left 90 degrees
bob.forward(50)

turtle.mainloop()
```

- Your arrow should now have an abrupt left turn in it
- _Note: The textbook uses other names for these functions (`fd`, `lt`, etc.). Use either name, both do the same thing._

## Simple repetition

- If we try and draw a square we would end up with this code

```python
import turtle

bob = turtle.Turtle()

bob.forward(100)
bob.left(90)

bob.forward(100)
bob.left(90)

bob.forward(100)
bob.left(90)

bob.forward(100)

turtle.mainloop()
```

- Since we basically do the same thing each time, we can use a `for` statement to save us some time

```python
import turtle

bob = turtle.Turtle()

for i in range(4):
    bob.forward(100)
    bob.left(90)

turtle.mainloop()
```

- A `for` statement is an example of a **loop** or **iteration**
- Loops tell the computer to repeat a block of code a certain number of times
- We end up with an extra turn at the end, which isn't a big deal in this case, but beware of repeating excess amounts of code

## Drawing your initials

- Sole assignment for this chapter is to draw your initials
- The letters should _not_ be connected
- The functions `penup()` and `pendown()` will allow you to move without drawing
- For the rest of the turtle functions, see <https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html>
- An example with me initials is at <https://github.com/wkurzius/intro-to-game-programming-notes/blob/master/4_initials.py>
