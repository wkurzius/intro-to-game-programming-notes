# 4: Turtles and functions

- First step towards creating a game
- We'll use the `turtle` module that comes with Python installations
- We'll control a 'turtle' and use it to create simple graphics

## The `turtle` module

- Create a new script (File > New File in IDLE) and save it, making sure to give it a meaningful name (e.g. `turtle_script.py`)
- Enter in the following code (you can omit the comments) and run it (Run > Run Module or F5 in IDLE)
- A window should appear with an arrow drawn in it

```python
import turtle

bob = turtle.Turtle()   # creates a Turtle object and assigns it to the variable bob
bob.forward(100)        # moves our Turtle named bob forward 100 pixels

turtle.mainloop()       # 
```

- The `turtle` module provides a function called `Turtle` that creates a Turtle object, which we assign to a variable named bob
- Modify your script by adding two new lines and run it again

```python
import turtle

bob = turtle.Turtle()
bob.forward(100)
bob.left(90)        # add this line
bob.forward(50)     # and this one

turtle.mainloop()
```

- Your arrow should now have an abrupt left turn in it
