# 2: Variables, expressions, and statements

- A **variable** is name for a value
- Similar to how it's used in algebra
- Could be an unknown that's determined later

## Assignment statements

- **Assignment statements** create a new variable and assign it a value

```python
>>> message = 'And now for something completely different'
>>> n = 17
>>> pi = 3.141592653589793
```

- Note that no message is displayed after an assignment command
- To see that your variable is assigned, you can enter it on a line by itself
- The assigned value will be printed to the console

```python
>>> n
17
```

## Variable names

- Variable names must start with a letter, but they can contain numbers
- Some characters are illegal along with some specific words, like `class`

```python
>>> 76trombones = 'big parade'
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
>>> more@ = 1000000
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
>>> class = 'Advanced Theoretical Zymurgy'
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

- In Python, it's convention to use **`snake_case`** for variable names
- `means_no_uppercase_letters_and_spaces_are_replaced_with_underscores`
- You also want to use descriptive variable names
- `ground_speed` is a much better variable name than `s`

## Expressions and statements

- Before moving on, a quick word on **expressions** and **statements**
- Expressions are **evaluated**, meaning they produce a value

```python
>>> 42
42
>>> n
17
>>> n + 25
42
```

- Statements on the other hand are **executed**
- You've seen two types so far: print statements and assignment statements

## Script mode

- So far we've run Python in **interactive mode**
- Useful for a few lines of a code, but for bigger programs you want to create a **script**
- Python scripts are just text files with a `.py` extension
- If you are running IDLE
  - File > New File
  - Save it somewhere and enter your code
  - Run > Run Module (or F5) to run your program
- If you are using PythonAnywhere you'll have to make a new file
  - On the Dashboard click 'Browse files'
  - In the textbox asking for a new file name enter one (don't forget the `.py`)
  - Run button is in the top right of the screen when editing the file
- Try out script mode by entering the code below in a script and running it

```python
miles = 26.2
miles * 1.61
```

- You should notice there is no output
- With scripts, there is no automatic output like interactive mode

```python
>>> miles = 26.2
>>> miles * 1.61
42.182
```

- If you want something printed to the console, you'll have to use a print statement

```python
miles = 26.2
print(miles * 1.61)
```

```bash
Output:
42.182
```

## Input

- You can get user input by using the `input()` function
- Script execution pauses at an `input()` while it waits for user input

```python
>>> x = input("Enter a number: ")
Enter a number: 5
>>> x * 4
'5555'
>>> type(x)
<class 'str'>
```

- Any input is stored as a `string`
- To use it a number you'll need to convert it

```python
>>> int(x)
5
>>> 5 * 4
20
```

- You can also convert it directly

```python
>>> y = float(input("Enter a decimal: "))
Enter a decimal: 12.3
>>> y + 3.21
15.510000000000002
```

- That example highlights a problem with floating point numbers in computers
- It involves repeating decimals and how they are represented in binary
- Know the problem exists, but it can mostly be ignored

## Comments

- Code is hard to read, especially if it was written by somebody else
- **Comments** help with this as they have no effect on the program

```python
# compute the percentage of the hour that has elapsed
percentage = (minute / 60) * 100
```

- Start with a `#` and are also useful for temporarily deactivating part of your program
- _**Use descriptive variable names**_
- Will make your code much more readable and reduce need for comments

```python
percentage_of_hour = (minute / 60) * 100
```

## Types of errors

To help your debugging process, here are the types of errors you'll run into and how to deal with them

### Syntax

- Program will not run since there is a structural problem with your code
- Example would be not closing parentheses for failing to assign a variable a value before using it

### Runtime

- Program runs, but then errors out before it finishes
- Example would be dividing by zero
- Typically don't occur in simple programs, but you'll see them later

### Semantic

- Program runs and completes, but doesn't do what you intended it to do
- Also referred to as a **logic error**
- Program is doing exactly what it was told to do, but what you told it wasn't right
