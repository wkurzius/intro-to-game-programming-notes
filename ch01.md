# 1: The way of the program

## What is a program

- Program is instructionson how to perform a task (or computation)
- The language of a program typically has 5 types of instructions
  - input
  - output
  - math
  - conditional execution
  - repetition
- Programming is **taking large tasks and breaking them into smaller tasks**

## Running Python

### Quick and easy

- [PythonAnywhere.com](https://PythonAnywhere.com)
- Create beginner (i.e. free) account
- From Dashboard, make a new Python console

### Less quick and easy

- Install Python on your machine from [Python.org](https://www.python.org/)
- Exact procedure depends on machine
- Open IDLE

## The interpreter

- First two or three lines tell you about Python version and the machine itself
- Check version number before continuing
- Should be Python 3.x
- If it's 2.x, you'll need to find a way to switch to 3.x
- Last line is the **prompt** and looks like

```python
>>>
```

- Prompt is where you can type code
- Try `print('Hello, world!')`

```python
>>> print('Hello, world!')
Hello, world!
```

- Congrats on your first program!
- That was a **print statement**
- Useful for outputting to the console
- The single quotes mark the beginning and end of the text to print (or output)

## Arithmetic operators

- We've tackled output already, so let's look at math
- `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` are for adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing

```python
>>> 40 + 2
42
>>> 43 - 1
42
>>> 6 * 7
42
>>> 84 / 2
42.0
```

- Dividing tacks on a decimal point for reasons we'll get into later
- To raise to a power use `**` (_**not**_ `^` as is customary elsewhere)

```python
>>> 6**2 + 6
42
```

## Values and types

- Values are the data an instruction uses
- So `2`, `42.0`, and `'Hello, world!'` are all values
- There are different **types** of values
- Ones we've seen so far
  - `2` is an **integer**
  - `42.0` is a **floating-point number**, or **float**
  - `'Hello, world!'` is a **string**
- You can check the type in the interpreter
- Note that `class` is the same thing as a type

```python
>>> type(2)
<class 'int'>
>>> type(42.0)
<class 'float'>
>>> type('Hello, World!')
<class 'str'>
```

- The single-quotes for strings are important

```python
>>> type(3)
<class 'int'>
>>> type('3')
<class 'str'>
```

- Despite appearances, the use of quotes makes the value a string

## Debugging

- A **bug** is something in your code that is preventing it from running properly
- You might spend minutes, hours, or even days trying to find and fix certain bugs
- **Debugging** comes with the territory of programming
- It will be enfuriating and sometimes embarassing
- Be prepared to deal with them and _**don't be afraid to ask for help**_
