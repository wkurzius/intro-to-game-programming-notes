# Conditionals and Logic

- Chapter focuses on 
- Book will cover recursion, but we will skip since its uses in game programming are very limited

## Floor division and modulus

- First, some useful operations for manipulating and testing numbers
- **Floor division** divides two numbers and rounds down, eliminating the decimal

```python
>>> 105 / 60
1.75
>>> 105 // 60
1
```

- The **modulus operator** divides two numbers and returns the remainder

```python
>>> 5 % 2
1
>>> 123 % 10
3
```

## Boolean expressions

- **Boolean expressions** evaluate to either `True` or `False`
- One example is `==` which checks if two values are equal

```python
>>> 5 == 5
True
>>> 2 == 3
False
```

- `True` and `False` are not `string` types, but `bool`
- And the capitalization matters

```python
>>> type(true)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<pyshell#2>", line 1, in <module>
    type(true)
NameError: name 'true' is not defined
>>> type(True)
<class 'bool'>
```

- The rest of the boolean operators are

|Operation|Description|
|--|--|
|`x != y` | `x` is not equal to `y`|
|`x > y`  | `x` is greater than `y`|
|`x < y`  | `x` is less than `y`|
|`x >= y` | `x` is greater than or equal to `y`|
|`x <= y` | `x` is less than or equal to `y`|

## Logical operators

- There are three **logical operators**: `and`, `or`, and `not`
- They can be used to make more complex boolean expressions

```python
>>> 24 % 3 == 0 and 24 % 2 == 0
True
```

## Conditional execution

- **Conditional statements** give you the ability to execute code _only_ if certain conditions exist
- They use blocks, similar to functions and loops

```python
x = float(input('Enter a number:\n'))
if x > 0:
    print('x is positive')
```

- You can also program alternative execution

```python
if x % 2 == 0:
    print('x is even')
else:
    print('x is odd')
```

- You can also chain conditionals together with `elif` (else if) statements

```python
if x < y:
    print('x is less than y')
elif x > y:
    print('x is greater than y')
else:
    print('x and y are equal')
```

- You can also omit the `else` option if you don't need it

```python
if choice == 'a':
    draw_a()
elif choice == 'b':
    draw_b()
elif choice == 'c':
    draw_c()
```

- For more complicated logical execution you can **nest** conditionals

```python
if x == y:
    print('x and y are equal')
else:
    if x < y:
        print('x is less than y')
    else:
        print('x is greater than y')
```
