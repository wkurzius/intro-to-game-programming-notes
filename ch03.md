# 3: Functions

- A **function** is named group of statements
- Functions are useful for when you need to reuse a part of code
- Whenever you need to use that code, you simply **call** the function

## Function calls

- You've seen two functions already

```python
>>> type(42)
<class 'int'>
>>> print('Hello, world!')
Hello, world!
```

- The name of function is what comes before the parentheses, so `type` and `print`
- In the parentheses is the **argument**
- This is the information the function needs in order to run

### Type conversion

- Python provides functions that convert values from one type to another
- Useful for converting user input (which is typically strings) to ints or floats

```python
>>> int('32')
32
>>> int('Hello')
ValueError: invalid literal for int(): Hello
```

```python
>>> int(3.99999) #drops whatever comes after the decimal point
3
>>> int(-2.3)
-2
```

```python
>>> float(32)
32.0
>>> float('3.14159')
3.14159
```

```python
>>> str(32)
'32'
>>> str(3.14159)
'3.14159'
```

## Math functions and importing

- Besides the math operations we've seen, there are more available
- Need to **import** the math **module** before they can be used

```python
>>> import math
```

- We now have a **module object** called `math` and can access all of its functions using **dot notation**

```python
>>> radians = 0.7
>>> math.sin(radians)
0.644217687237691
```

```python
>>> degrees = 45
>>> radians = degrees / 180.0 * math.pi
>>> math.sin(radians)
0.707106781187
```

- Each of these functions provide a **return value**
- This is a value that is sent back when the function completes
- Not every function returns a value, for instance `print()` does not return any value and instead just outputs to the console
- Functions that don't return a value are **void functions**
- For a list of all the `math` functions see <https://docs.python.org/2/library/math.html>

## Adding new functions

- In addition to using built-in functions, you can define your own with a **function definition**

```python
def print_lyrics():
    print("I'm a lumberjack, and I'm okay.")
    print("I sleep all night and I work all day.")
```

- The first line starts with `def` and tells the interpreter that a function definition is incoming
- The next part is the name of the function followed by a set of parentheses and a colon
- The body of the function comes next and _note that it's indented_
- The indentation tells the interpreter that it is part of the function
- As soon a line appears that isn't indented it's treated like it's outside of the function

```python
def print_lyrics():
    print("I'm a lumberjack, and I'm okay.")
    print("I sleep all night and I work all day.")
print_lyrics()
```

- Above is more complete script, where the function is defined and then called, which would output...

```none
I'm a lumberjack, and I'm okay.
I sleep all night and I work all day.
```

- You could also use the interpreter to define a function, which would look something like below depending on your setup

```python
>>> def print_lyrics():
    print("I'm a lumberjack, and I'm okay.")
    print("I sleep all night and I work all day.")
```

- You also call your function from within other functions

```python
def print_lyrics():
    print("I'm a lumberjack, and I'm okay.")
    print("I sleep all night and I work all day.")

def repeat_lyrics():
    print_lyrics()
    print_lyrics()

repeat_lyrics()
```

### Single and double quotes

- The example above used double-quotes instead of single-quotes around the string
- Both work, but the use of double quotes allowed the use of the apostrophe
- Alternatively, you can use the backslash (`\`) to tell Python to ignore the single quotes special meaning
- The backslash is referred to as an **escape character**

```python
def print_lyrics():
    print('I\'m a lumberjack, and I\'m okay.')
    print('I sleep all night and I work all day.')
```

## Flow of execution

- Try modifying the script and put the `repeat_lyrics()` call first like below

```python
repeat_lyrics()

def print_lyrics():
    print("I'm a lumberjack, and I'm okay.")
    print("I sleep all night and I work all day.")

def repeat_lyrics():
    print_lyrics()
    print_lyrics()
```

- This breaks the **flow of execution**
- Python reads code from top to bottom, so when `repeat_lyrics()` is called it hasn't been defined yet
- Note that functions aren't run until they are called
- So the below _does_ work Even though `print_lyrics()` is defined after `repeat_lyrics()`

```python
def repeat_lyrics():
    print_lyrics()
    print_lyrics()

def print_lyrics():
    print("I'm a lumberjack, and I'm okay.")
    print("I sleep all night and I work all day.")

repeat_lyrics()
```

- But the below _doesn't_ work since `repeat_lyrics()` is being called before `print_lyrics()` was defined

```python
def repeat_lyrics():
    print_lyrics()
    print_lyrics()

repeat_lyrics()

def print_lyrics():
    print('I\'m a lumberjack, and I\'m okay.')
    print('I sleep all night and I work all day.')
```

- The safe bet is to define all of your functions before calling any of them

## Parameters and arguments

- We've looked at arguments earlier as the information a function needs to run
- Can also define your functions to require information

```python
def print_twice(some_value):
    print(some_value)
    print(some_value)

print_twice('bob')
```

- The variable defined in the parentheses is a  **parameter**
- The information given to the function when it is called is the **argument**
- So `some_value` is a parameter and `'bob'` is the argument
- Any value can used as an argument, including variables

```python
>>> print_twice('Spam '*4)
Spam Spam Spam Spam
Spam Spam Spam Spam
>>> michael = 'Eric, the half a bee.'
>>> print_twice(michael)
Eric, the half a bee.
Eric, the half a bee.
```

- An important note is that the variable `some_value` in our function is a **local variable**
- Any variable defined in a function exists _only_ in the function
- Since parameters are variables also, this goes for them, too

```python
def local_test():
    cat = 'meow'
    print(cat)

local_test()
print(cat)
```

Output:

```none
meow
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "D:\Desktop\crap.py", line 6, in <module>
    print(cat)
NameError: name 'cat' is not defined
```

- `print(cat)` only works inside the function
- Trying to access it outside results in an error

## Function benefits

- Readability
  - Naming a group of statements makes your program easier to read and debug.
- Repetition
  - Functions can make a program smaller by eliminating repetitive code
- Debugging
  - Dividing a program into functions allows you to debug one part at a time
  - When everything works you can assemble them into a working whole
- Recycling
  - Well-designed functions are often useful for many programs
  - Once you write and debug one, you can reuse it
