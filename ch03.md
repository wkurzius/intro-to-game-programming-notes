# 3: Functions

- A **function** is named group of statements
- Functions are useful for when you need to reuse a part of code
- Whenever you need to use that code, you simply **call** the function

## Function calls

- You've seen two functions already

```python
>>> type(42)
<class 'int'>
>>> print('Hello, world!')
Hello, world!
```

- The name of function is what comes before the parentheses, so `type` and `print`
- In the parentheses is the **argument**
- This is the information the function needs in order to run
