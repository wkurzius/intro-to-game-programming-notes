# Brief guide to Git and Github

**Git** is version control software. As you commit changes to your work, Git keeps track of what changes and allows you to revert back to previous versions. There are other features, but we'll be using this for the most part.

**GitHub** is a hosting service for Git repositories (you can think of repositories as projects). We'll be using GitHub as a kind of backup service. A copy of your project will be stored online and can be accessed anywhere. So, it will act as a replacement for your storage folder.
